The **Authorization Api** allows the `Policy Enforcement Point` (`PEP`) and the `Policy Decision Point` (`PDP`) to communicate. The `PEP` sends authorization requests, and the `PDP` responds with decisions. They do not need to know how the other works internally.

## Payload

The payload defines the format of the data shared between the `PEP` and the `PDP`.

### Request Payload

The request payload contains the following elements:

- **`principal`**:
  The identity of the user or system making the authorization request. This identity has been authenticated by the identity provider. The `principal` and the `subject` are often the same, but they can be different. The `principal` is represented by an `identity_token` and an `access_token`. This is different from the API key used to authenticate the `PEP` with the `PDP`.

- **`policy_store`**:
  The storage that holds the policies used to evaluate the request. It includes a `type` and an `id`. The policy store supports the ledger but is designed to be flexible, allowing other types of policy stores to be added as needed.

- **`entities`**:
  The payload supports multiple policy engines, each with its own entity schema. Entities are defined by a `schema` name and a list of `items` that follow this schema.

- **`subject`, `resource`, `action`, `context`**:
  These elements define the subject (who is requesting access), the resource (what is being accessed), the action (what operation is performed), and the context (time-related details of the request). These elements follow widely recognized authorization standards, such as [OpenID AuthZEN](https://openid.net/wg/authzen/specifications/).

- **`evaluations`**:
  A list of access requests that a `principal` can use to evaluate multiple access decisions in a single message exchange. This allows checking permissions for multiple subjects at once, a process also known as "boxcarring" requests.

{{< callout context="note" icon="info-circle" >}}
**Permguard** enables Zero Trust principles, and the Authorization Api follows the same approach. The `principal` can send an authentication token along with the authorization request. This allows enforcing Zero Trust security by validating the token and ensuring that the `principal` is allowed to act on behalf of the `subject`, for example, in the context of trusted elevation and trusted delegation.

If the `principal` does not have permission to act on a `subject`, the request will return an error to block unauthorized actions.

Passing the `principal` with its access token helps protect against specific types of attacks, including:

1. Authorization Inference Attack
2. Excessive Data Exposure
3. Side-Channel Attack on Authorization
4. Privilege Escalation

This approach makes the `PDP` more secure by ensuring that information is not exposed to the `PEP` unless it is within an authorized context. It also supports trusted delegation, allowing `principals` to act on behalf of others securely when permitted.

### Response Payload

The response payload includes the following elements:

- **`decision`**:
  The decision element specifies whether the request is allowed or denied. The decision is a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
- **`context`**:
  The context element provides additional information about the decision, including the reason for the decision. The context includes an `id` and `reason_admin` and `reason_user` objects. The `reason_admin` object contains information for the administrator, while the `reason_user` object contains information for the user.

## Sample Payloads

Here is an example of an **authorization request** and its response exchanged between the `PEP` and the `PDP`.
