**Permguard** provides `SDKs` for various `programming languages`, allowing applications to integrate seamlessly with `Permguard` and act as a `Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)`.  

Through the `SDK`, an application can request `authorization decisions` and `enforce` them at the appropriate points in its execution flow.
