## Key Goals of Permguard

**Permguard** aims to redefine authorization by introducing a **Zero Trust–first approach**, built on the principles of policies being **Transferable and Verifiable**, **Versionable and Immutable**, and **Resilient to Disconnection**.

This foundation enables secure, scalable, and resilient authorization across distributed environments.
