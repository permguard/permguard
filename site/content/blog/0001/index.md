In today’s digital landscape, authentication is essential, but it’s not enough.

True security requires a modern authorization model—programmable, repeatable, and built for scalable governance.

Managing access to sensitive data and services across applications can be challenging with outdated models that are slow and difficult to govern as corporate requirments grow.

{{< /callout >}}

**Permguard** secures your application layer with Policy-as-Code, using Cedar Policy Language and extensible with other policy engines. Centralize policies and manage multi-namespace resources and user actions with PBAC.

- Built for scale, **Permguard** supports multi-zone and multi-tenant setups, perfect for complex environments. Developers can seamlessly plan and deploy permissions, backed by Git-like object storage that guarantees immutability and versioning out of the box to meet enterprise compliance needs.

- Designed for enterprise use, **Permguard** includes a toolchain that helps developers manage multiple versions and authorization models. It accommodates patterns that arise in complex cloud-native or microservices architectures, yet is versatile enough to be used even with simpler applications like a "Hello World" app.

- With real-time evaluation and eventual consistency, policies remain synchronized across Kubernetes, serverless, VMs, IoT, or edge nodes. Proximity nodes ensure permissions are evaluated instantly where they matter most.

- Simple, fast, and secure. Integrate **Permguard**’s SDK, and you’re ready to scale.

This is the future of cloud-native authorization. **Permguard** is setting new standards in governance and access control.
