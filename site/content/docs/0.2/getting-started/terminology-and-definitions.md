The **Permguard Terminology and Definitions** section provides clear explanations of key terms and concepts essential for understanding the architecture. Use this resource to quickly clarify any terminology encountered throughout the documentation.

## Core Concepts

- **Zero Trust**:
  *Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust for any user, device, or system, whether inside or outside the network perimeter. It enforces continuous verification for every access request, ensuring a robust security posture.*
  [Learn more about Zero Trust](https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture).

- **ZTAuth***:
  *ZTAuth* is a modern approach to implementing Zero Trust principles at the application layer. It provides a scalable architecture for managing authorization and authentication models, emphasizing replicability, versioning, and adaptability to partially connected environments such as proximity nodes.

- **Application Boundaries**:
  Application boundaries define the logical limits of an applicationâ€™s scope, typically isolating its access control and data management.
