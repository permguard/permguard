**Permguard** is a modern, open-source authorization provider designed around the core principles of **Zero Trust Security**.

It leverages the **Zero Trust Auth*** ([ZTAuth*](https://github.com/ztauthstar)) architecture to ensure that every access request is continuously verified, regardless of application boundaries or contextual constraints.

By integrating **Zero Trust**, Permguard provides a robust foundation for securing identities, resources, and actions in distributed systems, ensuring that trust is never assumed and always validated.

It helps you easily manage permissions by defining who can do what in your system.

Designed for `cloud-native`, `edge`, and multi-tenant environments, PermGuard allows you to update your authorization policies without changing your application code, saving time and effort.

These policies are centrally managed, ensuring compliance with corporate governance.

Permguard may seem complex, but it’s not: its internal architecture is sophisticated, yet integration is simple—perfect for everything from 'Hello World' apps to enterprise solutions. Just run the server, define your policy, and integrate it.

**Permguard** can be deployed anywhere: `public or private clouds`, `managed infrastructure`, `Kubernetes`, `serverless` systems, or even in `partially connected` environments where consistent connectivity is a challenge. It is also ideal for use in `edge nodes` and `IoT` ecosystems, ensuring secure and consistent permission management across diverse setups.

It follows a `Bring Your Own Identity (BYOI)` approach, meaning it works with your existing authentication system instead of replacing it.
You can configure identity sources to migrate identities from your current `identity provider`, ensuring all permissions are managed consistently and centrally, no matter where you use **Permguard**.

The main goal of PermGuard is to provide a robust authorization provider along with its own administrative and authorization components. It allows the association of identity sources through ingestion APIs, but these identity sources must be integrated using bespoke solutions. This approach ensures that PermGuard remains flexible and avoids unnecessary customizations and complexity in management.

The solution is `language-agnostic`, supporting multiple policy languages, starting with [Cedar Policy Language](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en).
Developers can use their preferred language from the ones integrated, while ensuring all federated PermGuard servers work seamlessly together, even if they use different languages internally.

`PermGuard` uses a common `schema` to define `Namepsaces` `Resources`, and `Actions`, ensuring consistency.
Each language is integrated with a small abstraction layer that doesn’t limit developers, except for a few reserved keywords.

To enforce the access control process, the application can integrate one of the available **SDKs** or manually integrate the native **APIs**.

This approach allows detailed permissions to specify who or what can access resources, while keeping the system flexible and easy to use.

- `Who`: *Identities (Users and Actors)*
- `Can Access`: *Permissions granted by attaching policies*
- `Resources`: *Resources targeted by permissions*
