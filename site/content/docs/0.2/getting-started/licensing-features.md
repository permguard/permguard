**Permguard** is an open-source project licensed under the **Apache-2.0 license**. Its core objective is to act as a flexible and powerful **authorization provider** that supports policies written in various languages. In addition, it introduces an **opinionated layer** to guide how **schemas** and **models** for authorization (AuthZ) and authentication (AuthN) should be structured.

## Key Goals of Permguard

- **Multi-Policy Execution**: Permguard is designed to execute policies written in different languages, enabling flexibility and interoperability across various systems.

- **Opinionated Framework**: It provides a clear and structured layer for designing authorization and authentication models, offering best practices for modern identity and access management.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Built with a focus on scalability, Permguard supports multi-application and multi-tenant environments, empowering organizations to manage access control efficiently.

- **Zero Trust Compliance**: By adopting the **Zero Trust Auth** ([ZTAuth*](https://medium.com/ztauth)) architecture, Permguard implements versionable and composable **Auth\*** models that can be replicated in **proximity nodes**. This allows it to overcome the limitations of partially connected devices and ensures seamless policy enforcement across diverse environments.

- **Open Source First**: With its Apache-2.0 license, Permguard is open to the community, encouraging collaboration and innovation in access control and policy management.
