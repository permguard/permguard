The **Permguard CLI** provides a robust toolset for interacting with Permguard servers.

The CLI is designed for two primary scenarios.

- In the context of **Permguard Server Administration**: it enables the management of `applications`, `identity sources`, `identities`, `tenants`, and `ledgers` directly on the remote server. This allows administrators to maintain and configure the system efficiently.
- For developers, the CLI supports a complete **Policy-as-Code Workspace**. It facilitates the local development of configuration artifacts such as `schemas`, `namespaces`, `resources`, `policies`, and `permissions`, integrating the essential toolchain required for the development lifecycle. These locally created artifacts can then be seamlessly applied to the remote server, ensuring a consistent and scalable approach to policy deployment across environments.

To view a list of commands available in the current Permguard version, users can run the **permguard** command without any additional arguments.

To obtain detailed help for a specific command, users can utilize the --help option alongside the relevant subcommand.
For instance, to access help information about the `applications` subcommand, users can execute the following command:

```bash
permguard applications --help
```

It's important to note that the output of the command line can be either in the default `TERMINAL` or `JSON` format by setting the output flag.

For instance to list all applications in the default terminal format, users can execute the following command:

```bash
permguard applications list
```

To list all applications in JSON format, users can execute the following command:

```bash
permguard applications list --output json
```
