The **Permguard Essential Terminology** section explains key terms and concepts essential for understanding the architecture. Use this resource to quickly find definitions for terms used throughout the documentation.

## Core Concepts

- **Zero Trust**:
  *Zero Trust* is a security model that does not assume implicit trust for any user, device, or system, whether inside or outside the network. It requires continuous verification for every access request to maintain strong security.
  [Learn more about Zero Trust](https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture).

- **ZTAuth\***:
  **ZTAuth\*** applies **Zero Trust** principles at the application layer. It provides a scalable framework for managing authorization and authentication models, focusing on replicability, versioning, and adaptability in partially connected environments like proximity nodes.

- **Application Boundaries**:
  Application boundaries define the logical scope of an application, including its access control and data management.
