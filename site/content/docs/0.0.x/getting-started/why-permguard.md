In today's digital world, **identity is the foundation** of most security systems. Authentication has improved with standards like Single Sign-On, OAuth, and OpenID Connect, but **authorization is still fragmented and less developed**.

**Permguard** is powerful yet easy to use. Its advanced architecture ensures security and flexibility, while integration remains simpleâ€”whether for a basic app or a complex enterprise system. Just run the server, define your policy, and integrate it seamlessly.

## The Problem with Authorization Today

</div><br/>

Most systems see **authorization** as a secondary concern, often tightly linked to applications or identity providers. This leads to several challenges:

- **No Standardization**: Unlike authentication, authorization lacks universal protocols or dedicated frameworks.
- **Tied to Identity Providers**: Authentication answers *"Who are you?"*, while authorization answers *"What are you allowed to do?"*. These should be separate but equally important.
- **Difficult Integration**: Existing solutions are either too specific to an application or too generic, making it hard to fit the needs of modern systems.
- **Complex Governance**: Without a clear and independent authorization layer, managing permissions becomes inconsistent and hard to scale.

## The Need for a Dedicated Authorization Layer

</div><br/>

Just as authentication has evolved with dedicated identity providers and standardized protocols, **authorization also needs its own dedicated layer**. This layer should be:

- **Standardized**: A consistent way to define, enforce, and manage permissions across systems.
- **Independent from Identity**: Authorization should focus on *"what you can do"*, not just *"who you are"*, working separately from identity providers.
- **Flexible and Interoperable**: Able to integrate with different identity providers while maintaining a unified authorization model.
- **Governance-Friendly**: Transparent and easy to audit, ensuring compliance with security and regulatory requirements.

## Integration with Your Own Identity Provider

</div>

**Permguard** follows the **Bring Your Own Identity (BYOI)** approach, allowing integration with existing identity providers.

This flexibility lets organizations keep their preferred authentication systems while using **Permguard** for advanced authorization management.

## What Permguard Brings to the Table

</div><br/>

**Permguard** is built to solve authorization challenges with an open-source, flexible, and dedicated approach. Key features include:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Authorization is managed independently from authentication, ensuring clarity, scalability, and easier maintenance.
- **Integration-First Design**: Supports multiple policy languages and flexible APIs, making integration into existing systems seamless.
- **Governance-Ready**: Includes tools to define, enforce, and audit policies, simplifying compliance and governance management.
- **Trusted Statements**: Implements **Trusted Elevation** and **Trusted Delegation**, allowing organizations to federate securely while enforcing **Zero Trust** principles.

## A Future of Simplified Authorization

  <img alt="Permguard" src="/images/diagrams/d12.webp"/>
</div><br/>

**Permguard** envisions a future where authorization is a core security component, not an afterthought. With a dedicated layer, it helps organizations:

- Build secure and scalable systems.
- Maintain consistent access control across applications and environments.
- Establish **Trusted Statements** such as **Trusted Elevation** and **Trusted Delegation**, enabling organizations to federate securely while following Zero Trust principles.
- Simplify governance and compliance.

**Authorization** should receive the same attention and innovation as authentication. With **Permguard**, organizations get a reliable, flexible, and future-ready solution to manage permissions efficiently.
