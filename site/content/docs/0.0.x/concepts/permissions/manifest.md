A **Permguard** ledger must be associated with a manifest.

{{< callout context="note" icon="info-circle" >}}
Those manifest files are created automatically when a new workspace is initialized.
{{< /callout >}}

This **manifest**  is a mandatory element to define the following:

- **metadata**: Information about the authorization model
- **authz**
  - **runtime**: A runtime represents a specific environment that can be used to build and evaluate the authorization model.
  - **partition**: A partition defines a specific section of the authorization model, enabling a modular approach to its design.
