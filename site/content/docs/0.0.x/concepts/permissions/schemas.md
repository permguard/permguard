In **Permguard**, multiple ledgers can be created, and each ledger might have a single **schema** per `partition`.
This provides a structured way to model the authorization framework.

## Schema

A **schema** is a logical structure used to organize **resources** and **actions**.
It also includes **metadata annotations** to enhance policy management.

## Namespace

A schema can be further divided into **namespaces**, adding more granularity to resource management.
Namespaces provide another layer of logical organization, especially useful for schemas designed with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles.

By structuring schemas into namespaces, developers can simplify development and maintain architectural consistency.

```json
{
  "name": "magicfarmacia",
  "description": "Manage a pharmacy with multiple branches",
  "resources": []
}
```

Each **namespace** can define multiple **resources** and the corresponding **actions** that can be performed on them.

{{< callout context="caution" icon="alert-triangle" >}}
It is not mandatory to create a `Resource` for every entity within a zone, and the same applies to `Actions`.
However, it is recommended to define a **Resource** and an **Action** for any entity that requires explicit authorization modeling.

Typically, fewer Resources and Actions are defined compared to the total number of entities in a zone.
This prevents authorization layers from becoming too tightly coupled with the application logic.

## Resource

A **Resource** is a key entity in **Permguard**. It represents a logical element within the zone that requires authorization policies.

When defining **Resources**, consider:

- **Performance**: Ensure policies are structured efficiently to minimize evaluation time.
- **Scalability**: Optimize policy execution within the zone for better performance.

In summary, `Resources` in **Permguard** help structure authorization policies, ensuring flexibility and optimized performance within a **zone ecosystem**.

```json
{
  "name": "inventory",
  "description": "Pharmacy inventory",
  "actions": []
}
```

## Action

An **Action** is a specific operation that can be performed on a **Resource**.
Actions define what operations are allowed, such as:

- `read`
- `write`
- `delete`
- `list`

These actions help enforce precise authorization rules, ensuring that only permitted operations can be executed on a resource.

```json
{
  "name": "access",
  "description": "Access inventory"
}
```
