**Permguard** supports `multi-tenancy`, allowing multiple **tenants** to be created within each zone.

Tenants play a key role in managing authorizations and help **partition** `resources` and `actions` efficiently.
This is especially useful for **multi-tenant** zones, such as Software as a Service (**SaaS**) platforms.

{{< callout context="note" icon="info-circle" >}}
In the [MagicFarmacia sample](/docs/0.0.x/getting-started/hands-on-example/) each pharmacy branch is a separate tenant, such as `matera-branch` or `pisa-branch`.

This setup allows each branch to manage its own resources and actions independently.

**Multi-tenant management** is particularly valuable for companies building **SaaS products for B2B**.
In these cases:

- Each tenant represents a client organization using the SaaS platform.
- The client organization can manage its own users, resources, and permissions separately.
- The shared SaaS environment remains scalable and customizable for each tenant.

This approach ensures **scalability and flexibility**, allowing each tenant to tailor the platform to its specific needs.

Each tenant is identified by a unique `name`.

```json
{
  "name": "matera-branch"
}
```
