**Permguard** supports `multi-zone` architecture, allowing the creation of multiple **zones**.
Each zone is fully isolated, with its own tenants, identities, ledgers, manifests, schemas, policies, and permissions.

{{< callout context="caution" icon="alert-triangle" >}}
It is recommended to use a separate zone for each environment, such as development, staging, and production.
This best practice helps reduce security risks.
{{< /callout >}}

It is important to note that **Permguard** does not include an authentication layer.
The adopter is responsible for implementing or integrating authentication at the zone level.

In the [MagicFarmacia sample](/docs/0.0.x/getting-started/hands-on-example/) the `demo-zone` zone is created.
{{< /callout >}}

Each zone is uniquely identified by a `name`.

{
  "zone_id": 273165098782,
  "name": "magicfarmacia-dev"
}
