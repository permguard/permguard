An `identity` is a unique entity that represents either a **user** or an **actor**.

{{< callout context="note" icon="info-circle" >}}
In the [MagicFarmacia sample](/docs/0.0.x/getting-started/hands-on-example/) a users and an actor are created.
{{< /callout >}}

Identities are linked to identity sources.

```json
{
  "name": "google"
}
```

## Principal

A `Principal` is a human user or workload with granted permissions that authenticates and makes requests. It can be:

- A user
- An actor
- An assumed actor (a user acting as an actor or a workload assuming an actor)

## User

A `User` is an identity representing a single person or **Function Identifier (FID)** with specific permissions.

The name can be either a valid **Permguard** name or an email address.

```json
{
  "identity_type": "user",
  "name": "nicolagallo"
}
```

## Actor

An `Actor` is a virtual identity that a **Principal** can temporarily assume. It can represent:

- A **Role**: A predefined set of permissions for specific tasks, such as `"Approvals Manager"` or `"Compliance Reviewer"`.
- A **Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a user or service designed to perform tasks independently while reflecting the original identity.

**Permguard** allows systems to **optionally** adopt the Actor model, ensuring that every operation is executed under the specific permissions of the **Actor**, rather than the broader permissions of the **Principal**.

### Benefits of the Actor Model

1. **Zero Trust Security**: Requires elevation into an Actor, ensuring only the necessary permissions are used for a task, reducing risk and ensuring full traceability.
2. **Role Isolation**: Limits each Actor to its assigned role or context, preventing unnecessary access and ensuring clear separation of responsibilities.
3. **Future Federation**: Provides a foundation for secure collaboration across organizations. Defined roles and permissions allow **Permguard** to support federated systems where multiple organizations can work together while maintaining security boundaries.

This model enhances **security, flexibility, and scalability**, making it ideal for **distributed systems** and **multi-organization environments**.

```json
{
  "identity_type": "actor",
  "name": "branch-manager"
}
```
